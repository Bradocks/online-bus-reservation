assume this is my table

```sql
SELECT `id`, `name`, `mobile_number`, `email`, `role`, `user_name`, `password`, `id_no`, `dob`, `gender`, `staff_id` FROM `user` WHERE 1
```

I want to create a page to create, list, update & delete this entity

ensure no custom php functions are created, delete should have a pop up confirmation
